# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
 1. Take matrix input from the user and convert it to a NumPy array.
 
 2.Apply LU decomposition using scipy.linalg.lu() to get P, L, and U.

 3.Extract the L (lower) and U (upper) triangular matrices.

 4.Print the L and U matrices.


## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix

## Algorithm
1.Input matrix A and vector/matrix B from the user.

2.Perform LU factorization of matrix A using lu_factor().

3.Solve the system of equations AX = B using lu_solve().

4.Print the solution vector/matrix X.

(ii) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix


## Output:
## (i) To find the L and U matrix:
